# Power-Generation-through-Footsteps

There are many potential alternative and renewable sources energy like solar, wind, biomass, and
geothermal energy. Most unfortunately, human energy that could have been converted into electrical
energy for use at least by the small-scale business outfits, markets religious centres, event centres, club
houses, bus stations and parks, etc., are being wasted on daily basis. The ability to develop this system
of generating electricity through the human foot beats as an alternative to conventional electricity
supply could go a long way in boosting the economic potential of country. Therefore, a system of
generating electricity through the footsteps of people by converting the foot power applied on the stairs
to electrical energy, is stored in a battery and is used for activating the connected loads. The conversion
from kinetic energy to electrical energy is achieved by placing a mechanical footstep power generator
(piezoelectric) on the hind foot region. The result showed that generated power increased
proportionally with the mass of an individual. The ability to develop this system of generating
electricity through the human foot beats as an alternative to conventional electricity supply could go a
long way to boosting the economic potential of country. Therefore, this system was aimed at generating
electricity through the footsteps.
